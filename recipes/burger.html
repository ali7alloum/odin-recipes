    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This hamburger patty recipe uses ground beef and an easy bread crumb mixture. Nothing beats a simple hamburger on a warm summer evening! Enjoy on ciabatta, Kaiser, or potato rolls topped with your favorite condiments.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
    <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.
    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.
    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.
    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.
    <h4>Step 5</h4>
    Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).
