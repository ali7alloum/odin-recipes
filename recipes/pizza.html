    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This is a great recipe when you don't want to wait for the dough to rise. You just mix it and allow it to rest for 5 minutes and then it's ready to go! It yields a soft, chewy crust.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>Yeast</li>
    <li>Sugar</li>
    <li>Bread Flour</li>
    <li>Olive Oil</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Description</h3>
<h4>Step 1</h4>
<p>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</p>
<h4>Step 2</h4>
<p>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 3</h4>
<p>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</p>
<h4>Step 4</h4>
<p>Let rest for 5 minutes.</p>
<h4>Step 5</h4>
<p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</p>
<h4>Step 6</h4>
<p>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</p>
<h4>Step 7</h4>
<p>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>
<h4>Step 8</h4>
<p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</p>
<h3>Recipe Tip!</h3>
<b>You can use all-purpose flour, but bread flour makes a superior crust. If you have a pizza stone, dust it with cornmeal and use it instead of a greased pizza pan.</b>
